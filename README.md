# TheExperiment
This is the work of the experiment of my master's thesis. 
It uses RunExp as main function to run the experiment which consist of instruction, Study, Distraction, Test, and probelist. 
In addition, functions for construction of study and test lists from a word pool are also in this folder. 

This experiment is a modified version of Probed Recall Task that developed by Kılıç et. al. (2013) to specifically test the encoding dynamics of word pairs. Participants will study 10 lists consist of 10 word-pairs, do mathematical calculations in between each lists for one minute, and lastly will be tested. In the test, a probe pair will be presented for recognition, if the pair is recognized, they will be asked to recall __one__ word from the same list that probe was presented.
